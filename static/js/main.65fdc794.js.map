clusters for large amounts of markers.\n\t * <p>\n\t * This is an enhanced V3 implementation of the\n\t * <a href=\"http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n\t * >V2 MarkerClusterer</a> by Xiaoxi Wu. It is based on the\n\t * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n\t * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n\t * <p>\n\t * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n\t *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n\t *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n\t *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n\t *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n\t *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n\t *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n\t *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n\t * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n\t * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\t *\n\t *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\t *\n\t * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n\t * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\t * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\t * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n\t * limitations under the License.\n\t */\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * @name ClusterIconStyle\n\t * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n\t *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.

The input parameters for the function are (1) the array of markers\n\t *  represented by a cluster marker and (2) the number of cluster icon styles. It returns a\n\t *  {@link ClusterIconInfo} object. The default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n\t *  <code>text</code> property which is the number of markers in the cluster and an\n\t *  <code>index</code> property which is one higher than the lowest integer such that\n\t *  <code>10^i</code> exceeds the number of markers in the cluster, or the size of the styles\n\t *  array, whichever is less. The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of\n\t *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n\t *  <code>text</code> value of <code>\"125\"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>\n\t *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>\n\t *  array is <code>2</code>.

The element to be used to style a given cluster marker\n\t *  is determined by the function defined by the <code>calculator</code> property.\n\t *  The default is an array of {@link ClusterIconStyle} elements whose properties are derived\n\t *  from the values for <code>imagePath</code>, <code>imageExtension</code>, and\n\t *  <code>imageSizes</code>.\n\t * @property {boolean} [enableRetinaIcons=false] Whether to allow the use of cluster icons that\n\t * have sizes that are some multiple (typically double) of their actual display size.

@fileoverview\n * The library creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.\n * <p>\n * This is an enhanced V3 implementation of the\n * <a href=\"http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V2 MarkerClusterer</a> by Xiaoxi Wu. It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.
